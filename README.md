## Introduction
It's no secret that meditation is beneficial to our health. In fact, a recent study from <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/01/eight-weeks-to-a-better-brain/">Harvard</a> showed that meditation can lead to changes in brain structure that provide cognitive and psychological benefits. Breathe is an experimental application that seamlessly combines API data from YouTube and SoundCloud to help the user find peace of mind by presenting relaxing imagery and sounds in full-screen format.

## How it Works
Users are able to choose between 4 different scenes, each with its own accompanying audio. Although the video is embedded from YouTube and the audio is embedded from SoundCloud, the files were handpicked and carefully edited to provide the user with a seamless experience. After 5 second of inactivity, all components (including the mouse but excluding the video) will fade out to really help immerse the user in the currently selected scene.
