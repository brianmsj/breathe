## Introduction
It's no secret that meditation is beneficial to our health. In fact, a recent study from <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/01/eight-weeks-to-a-better-brain/">Harvard</a> showed that meditation can lead to changes in brain structure that provide cognitive and psychological benefits.
